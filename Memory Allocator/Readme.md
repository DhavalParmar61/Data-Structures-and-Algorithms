Bin_poly is implimentation of one bin allocation in pollynomial program and showing it's performance result. Same way poli_heap have program that tests performance of sheap allocator (A Weighted Buddy Method for Dynamic Storage Allocation) on pollinomial program. Uniform_test and Expo_test program tests sheap allocator for uniform and exponential distributed allocation and deallocation requests.
