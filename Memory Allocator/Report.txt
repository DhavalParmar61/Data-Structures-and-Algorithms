Here I have tested sheap allocator for both uniform and exponential allocation and deallocation requests. Interms of internal fragmentation average is 18.64% and 17.47% for exponential and uniform distribution requests respectively. so we can say that sheap is performing some what better for uniform distributed alllocation in termes of space. I have ilmplented this memory allocator in polynomial program. In terms of time spheap allocator is taking more time compare to one bin allocator that is due to splitting of area and buddy recombination. while in one bin there is nothing like splitting and recombination. Time taken with sheap allocator was 0.000542 sec while with onebin it was 0.000187 sec for division of polinomial (36,1),(15,2) with (4,1),(2,1).
